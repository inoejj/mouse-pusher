# Mouse Pusher
Mouse pusher

Mouse pusher is a complementary mechanical device for the med-pc operant boxes, to replace manual labor when propelling mice into the experiment arena.  Potentially, by freeing researcher from pushing multiple mice at the same time, the mouse pusher can improve efficiency and accuracy of the procedures and even reduce the audience effect on the mice. It has two parts, the 3d-printed chamber and electrical linear stage rail.
